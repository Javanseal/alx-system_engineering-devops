POSTMORTEM: OUTAGE OF WEB STACK SERVICE ON AUGUST 14TH, 2024
INCIDENT SUMMARY
On August 14th, 2024, at approximately 2:30pm, our web stack service experienced a major outage affecting user globally. The issue lasted for approximately 4 hours, during which time users were unable to access our services. The incident was resolved at 6:30pm, and normal operations have since resumed.
Timeline of Events
•	2:30PM: Monitoring systems detect increased error rates and latency across the web stack.
•	2:35PM: Initial alerts are generated, and the on-call engineering team is notified.
•	2:40PM: The team begins investigating, identifying a significant spike in database connection errors.
•	3:00PM: it is determined that the issue is related to a malfunctioning database cluster.
•	3:20PM: The database term begins manual intervention to restore functionality.
•	4:00PM: Partial restoration of service is achieved, but intermittent connectivity issues persist.
•	5:00PM: Full restoration of service confirmed after additional fixes and validation.
•	6:30PM: All systems are verified to be functioning normally. Post-incident review begins.
ROOT CAUSE
The outage was caused by a failure in our primary database cluster. Specifically, the issue was a bug in the database connection pooling software, which led to an excessive number of failed connections. This caused the database cluster to become unresponsive under load.
IMPACT
1.	Users: All users experienced complete service unavailability or degraded performance.
2.	Business: Significant customer dissatisfaction and potential loss of revenue due to the service disruption.
3.	Systems: High resource utilization and errors in the web stack’s monitoring and alerting systems.
RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY
	Immediate Actions: the database team restarted the affected database cluster and applied a temporary fix to the connection pooling software.
	Long-Term Actions: a patch was developed to address the bug in the connection pooling software and applied to the production environment. Additionally, we updated our monitoring systems to better detect and alert on such issues. 
 
LESSONS LEARNED 
1.	Monitoring: Enhance our monitoring capabilities to better detect database performance issues before the lead to widespread outages.
2.	Incident Response: improve coordination between engineering and database teams to reduce response time during similar incidents.
3.	Testing: implement more rigorous testing and validation procedures for database related changes to prevent similar issues in the future.
ACTION ITEMS
1.	Update monitoring tools: integrate more detailed database performance metrics into our monitoring systems.
2.	Improve documentation: document the incident response process and share insights with the broader team.
3.	Review testing procedures: conduct a thorough review of testing procedures for database and web stack changes.
CONCLUSION
The outage on August 14th, 2024, highlighted critical areas for improvement in our monitoring and incident response processes. We are committed to implementing the lessons learned to enhance the reliability and resilience of our web stack service. We apologize for the inconvenience caused and appreciate the understanding and patience of our users during this incident.
